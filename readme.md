# Archontos
Archontos is a forum made with Laravel 5.2 and Bootstrap 3.

Everything is freely available and usable the way you want. Only the public folder is missing, which you can freely make yourself.

As of now, the current release is completely bugged due to uncomplete migration to laravel 5.3, because of a lack of time. But it shall soon be.

Archontos was once used on a public forum.
