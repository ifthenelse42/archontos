# Archontos
Archontos is a forum made with Laravel 5.2 and Bootstrap 3.

This is NOT a CMS and so it's impossible to build your own forum with this.

Most core parts like the middlewares, the configurations and the database are intentionally missing, as it could be a source of potential security flaw. The public folder is also missing because it's useless to provide it, again because Archontos is not a CMS.

Basically, the Models (most of it), Views and Controllers are available.

Archontos was once used on a public forum.
